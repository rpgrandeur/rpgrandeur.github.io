    <p>Grandeur is a multiplayer, plot-driven, combat-heavy RP server and as such PVP conflict in canon is often inevitable and even necessary. This guide therefore exists to help you avoid certain problems that may arise from this, and provide context and rules in regards to and concerning what to expect once your character has joined the fray.</p>
    <h3 id="combat">Combat</h3>
    <p>Your character will be granted the opportunity to level up by gaining XP, which comes in through RP events and combat plays. Events will be fairly common in this server to get things up and running, however, there will always be a chance for your character to level up. In order to see how “powerful” a character is, your character will be ranked by stats. Stats rank a character on how well their power, intelligence, speed, technique, and skillfulness is. Stats are labeled as followed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>D Rank (D3 - D1)</li>
      <li>C Rank (C3 - C1)</li>
      <li>B Rank (B3 - B1)</li>
      <li>A Rank (A3 - A1)</li>
      <li>S Rank</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By being an active member and participating, your character will level up faster, and can climb the charts on becoming a top villain or superhero.</p>

    <h2>Combat and OC Deaths</h2>
    <p>Combat is an important part of our RP as Heroes and Villains (and rogues) exist to clash. In Grandeur, violence is sometimes - very often - the answer.</p>
    <p>Time passes in Turn Orders and Turns. A turn order is made up of all the turns/replies of every RPer involved in a given RP at a particular time. A turn is a single reply from an RPer that completes a turn order. In RP (IRP, in canon), a turn lasts 6 seconds so that 10 turns are required for a minute to pass (unless the RPers involved agree to a faster or slower progression of time in their interaction).</p>
    <p>Game Masters (GMs) oversee events and RPs and make sure that OCs stick to their limits and that events of an RP are logical in context of the characters' powers and the situation in which they are used. This, along with assigned stats, help to prevent <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=god%20modding">Godmodding</a> and make it clear when certain actions succeed and when they fail.</p>
    <p>An OC may be killed in combat (or otherwise) if they take damage that is fatal to them. Dead OCs will be retired and their status will be changed on the wiki as soon as is possible, meaning that their players will have lost said characters and would need to make new ones in order to continue RPing.</p>
    <p>Permission is not required for an OC to be killed. The rules, GMs and stats help make this a balanced playing field so that all characters enjoy similar advantages but intelligent RPing is necessary in order to avoid sudden deaths and you must choose what conflicts and scenarios you take part in very wisely.</p>
    <h2>Stats, XP and Ranking Up</h2>
    <p>In order to avoid uncontrolled use of powers that we expect will often be incredibly versatile or powerful, we make use of stats. Stats are assigned values that define the limits of an OC's powers and abilities (e.g. max. temperature achievable 100C) at their current rank (D-S rank). Stats are assigned to OCs during the approval process by Approvals Mods. A range of stats exist within each rank. Where an OC falls in this range is determined by the Mods and RPer during approval.</p>
    <p>In canon the ranks are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>D Rank (D3 - D1)</li>
      <li>C Rank (C3 - C1)</li>
      <li>B Rank (B3 - B1)</li>
      <li>A Rank (A3 - A1)</li>
      <li>S Rank</li>
    </ul>
    <p>OCs will normally begin at the bottom tier and make their way up the ladder. As they rank up, they may improve their abilities or stats if they choose. A number rank-up (C3 to C2) permits an improvement in stats as a new range of values becomes available for the OC. A letter rank-up (C to B rank) will allow the player to add a new, sensible aspect to their OC's powers if approved by the Mods.</p>
    <p>Characters rank up by taking part in RPs which yield XP. XP is counted and accumulated from RPs, in canon activity, participation and relevance. The higher an OC's XP, the higher they rank and thus, the stronger they become.</p>
    <p>In canon, this improvement is explained as an Awakening.</p>
    <h2>Events and Teaming Up</h2>
    <p>GMs will endeavour to create and run as many events as possible as smoothly and as often as possible. There will be overarching story-driven arcs, one-offs, missions and adventures of all sorts and it benefits your character a great deal to take part in as much of this as they possibly can. Events often give the greatest amount of XP when finished, not to mention they help your OC earn currency that will be rewarded to participants and currency will help you purchase equipment, costume pieces and even channels/lairs if sufficient.</p>
    <p>Some players and characters will prefer to work alone, and that is fine but there is great benefit in teamwork and joining guilds for both Heroes and Villains. OCs taking part in events with members of an established team they are a part of will more often than not, gain significantly more experience and currency (based on said guild's influence on the outcome) from those events than they would have if they were going it solo. This system exists to emphasize the canon importance of being part of a group that offers protection and resources far greater than a single individual can amass.</p>
    <p>All Heroes are already by default a part of the <a href="#">League of Heroes</a> but will get no great rewards for that as it is, as mentioned already, a default team membership and does not require much interaction to pull off. If your character is determined to go it alone and you have what it takes to go that route, then you should do that. Otherwise, it would be wise and incredibly rewarding and satisfying to be a part of something bigger than yourself.</p>
