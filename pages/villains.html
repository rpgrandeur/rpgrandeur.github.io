    <h2 id="villains">Villains</h2>
    <p>Villains are people who use their powers to commit crimes, cause destruction, and potentially put innocent lives at stake. There are many different types of villains in this world.</p>
    <p>Villains are generally groups of people, working together or operating individually, who abuse their gifts to benefit themselves instead of helping others. Unlike heroes, these people prefer to commit crime and atrocities. Villains may not always be mutants as all maleficent members of society possessing resources with which to bring about great harm or be a great threat to the masses may be considered villains.</p>
    <p>In the current age, the crime rate committed by villains is quite low as a result of pressure from the large amount of heroes.</p>
    <p>Villains act alone more often than heroes but also recognize the benefits of being affiliated with groups. There are a myriad of Villainous teams and alliances, constantly changing with time as their fickle partnerships begin and end. The most notable, long-lasting organisation of villains is the <a href="#">Mafia</a>.</p>
    <h3>The Most Wanted</h3>
    <p>The No. 1 Villain is called the Top Villain and regarded as the Symbol of Terror worldwide. Though, there has been no tradition of such a position existing, it is generally granted to whoever is so terrifyingly strong and hard to catch that the world's Law Enforcement has deemed them deserving of the title of "Most Wanted".</p>
