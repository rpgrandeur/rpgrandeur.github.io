    <h2 id="heroes">Heroes</h2>
    <p>Heroes are individuals who are licensed to use their powers to protect civilians from Villains, natural disasters, and/or any other kind of harm. Those who take heroism as a profession are referred to as Pro Heroes.</p>
    <p>Heroes generally work in groups known as Hero Agencies which must include the <a href="#">League of Heroes</a> as the parent or sole agency of said hero before any other sub-teams. The standard is one very strong Pro Hero in charge, and a number of weaker/newbie heroes who serve as Sidekicks under the primary Hero. All new heroes, fresh out of High School or College, must serve as Sidekicks to an established hero for a year before they are able to go solo.</p>
    <p>Some heroes prefer to work alone and are unaffiliated, save their League membership and license.</p>
    <p>In order for a person to become a licensed Pro Hero, they must undergo an education and training program in the subject of heroism. This Heroics course is integrated into a students High School education. The Heroics course includes rescue training, combat training, and even training for dealing with the media.</p>
    <p>Hero Names are considered very important to a professional career, as they can bring a person closer to the image they may want to cement, and are also able to reflect their true character.</p>
    <p>A Hero License is a certification that allows Pro Heroes to use their mutations freely. In order to obtain a Hero License, one must complete all three years of heroics education in High School or be otherwise certified by the League.</p>
    <p>The Social Media Superhero, also referred to as the "SMS", is a website that can only be accessed by Pro Heroes and registered members of the free press. It contains activity reports of Pro Heroes across the globe, as well as information on known Villains, including their names and abilities.</p>
    <p>Heroes can also use the Social Media Superhero Network to send requests for assistance to other Heroes who possess a mutation that may be useful for a determined crisis</p>
    <h3>The Ranking Billboard</h3>
    <p>Monthly, all Heroes and hero teams in the world are ranked by an event called the Global Hero Billboard Charts. The rating is determined by various factors, including a Hero's level of strength, number of resolved incidents and contributions to society (XP), and public approval (GM discretion).</p>
    <p>The official rankings are changed on the wiki to reflect the results, though they may vary from the official stats rankings (the strongest Hero may not always be the top, as a result of public approval ratings).</p>
    <p>The No.1 Hero is called the Top Hero and regarded as the symbol of peace worldwide. Their public image is of great importance. Saturn Girl was the first Top Hero.</p>
