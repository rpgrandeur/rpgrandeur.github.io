		<h1>Welcome to Grandeur!</h1>
		<p>A Superhero/Supervillain based roleplay that follows our faithful heroes and villains of Titan around. In this server, we have an extension of options for each character, civilian and mutant alike. You can create your own story through your OC, and we desperately hope you have fun here. In order to get yourself situated, we highly recommend reading through all of the lore channels which describe more-so what to expect and how things run. For now, you can read through some explanations so you’re able to get a feel for how our server operates.</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Heroes and Villains</h3>
	<p>With power, comes conflict. After the <a href="#">Voidwalkers</a> were thwarted, a new conflict rose to the forefront: Heroes vs. Villains.
		<br/>Due to this age-old rivalry against those who keep the order, and those who wish to uproot it, combat ends up being one of the main focuses of the RP, to which we have an extensive PVP system set in play to keep order.</p>
	<h3>Setting</h3>
	<p>Grandeur takes place in the wonderful city of Titan. Titan is a large city, extensive with many RP channels for a lot of RPs to take place! There’s unique parts to each place in Titan, which is worthy of checking out.
		<br>Everything is not quite what it seems, so always do a double take whilst wandering the streets. Ever since the <a href="#">League of Heroes</a> have been put in place, the crime rate in Titan has been lowering, however, there’s always something to keep your character busy here.</p>
	<h3>Mutants</h3>
	<p>Mutants are the most common type of people to become our heroes and villains! Mutants, essentially, are the ones with powers/abilities. Coming into play after the <a href="#">Voidwalkers</a> visited and spread a contagious virus to the human race, mutants began to grow in numbers. At first, mutants were not our lovable peoples with powers. People grew heavily afraid of them, and most were kept under heavy supervision.
		<br>However, as the years went on, mutants were normalized, but are still quite small in numbers. Generation after generation of mutants began popping up, and to this day, are still pretty much accepted by society.</p>
	<h3>Heroes</h3>
	<p>Heroes are the good guys of our story, obviously. These dudes come in many different shapes and sizes, but they all share one thing. They graduated from the <a href="#">League of Heroes</a>, an organization destined to help turn mutants into crime-fighting heroes.
		<br>There are always going to be your vigilantes, the ones who didn’t go through the trouble of proper schooling, but those seem to be gaining less and less popularity. Truthfully, Pro Heroes began after “The Trinity” helped kickstart the League of Heroes. If you want your character to become a Pro Hero, they’re going to have to graduate from the League of Heroes, and wear the proper ring to signify so.</p>
	<h3>Villains</h3>
	<p>On the opposite side of the spectrum, we have our villains. The crime inducing maniacs who bring terror to Titan, for reasons of their own. Most villains tend to go without schooling, however, a lot of villains have graduated from the League of Heroes and have ended up flipping over to the other side. Despite this, there are many villain organizations to benefit these guys, due to there not being much of a graduate program for them.
		<br>These organizations will help your villain characters in climbing up the charts and staying off the radar. A popular villain organization to keep the villains together is the Mafia, however, on the more logic side of things, The Firm will help your villain to survive this mess. Let’s just say, your character will have all things covered.</p>
	<h3>Ready for Glory and Grandeur?</h3>
	<p>Titan has a rich history of superheroes and supervillains, which continues to grow with each passing day.
		<br> Submit a character who will make history and immortalize them in the annals of our lore, or read about a few of your peers and the people who have come before you.</p>
